## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I had trouble using linking images in CSS using `url()` because i forgot to
  wrap the file path in double quotes ("")

```css
.selector {
  background-image: url("path/to/file.jpg");
}
```

- learnt to use `position: sticky`

```css
.attribution {
  position: sticky;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

- using SVG files as `<img>`, inline `<svg>` element and as an `<object>` in
  HTML

### Continued development

- working with SVG files and creating fallbacks for them
- breakpoints for responsiveness and view-port units

### Useful resources

- [Using SVG - CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/) - This helped me
  while using SVG files.
